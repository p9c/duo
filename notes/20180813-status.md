# State of Development

We will be making periodical reports of progress on the project to keep followers updated on progress. They will be posted into this repository with a numeric sort order date prefix and published on social media.

## Rewrite of the blockchain client

Loki (Discord ID: @loki#8355 ) is the main developer working on this but later others will be joining for some parts. The current activity is work on developing a significantly revamped and more secure wallet database.

It was decided to dispense with implementing a full read/write library to access and update the standard, legacy wallet.dat wallet database and write an import function for these wallets and store them in the app using the single, main database [JavazacDB](https://github.com/parallelcointeam/javazacdb), a fork of [Cete](https://github.com/1lann/cete), which creates a simple table-based interface for using the very fast and efficient key/value store [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger).

The standard wallet.dat has AES-256-CBC encryption for private keys only, but for true security anything in it that might help identify the owner or their counterparties, numerous other records should also be encrypted. The address book, transaction and accounting records, and all public keys will also be encrypted in the new `duo` Parallelcoin blockchain client.

A long un-implemented feature of multiple passwords will also be implemented so users can unlock a wallet with more than one password.

This will be completed in the next days and once the fully working, more secured wallet database is completed we will be building an RPC proxy interface that allows our developers to add functionality relating to the wallet, testing it on the live network, before the `duo` client has the full implementation of network/gossip/blockchain/index functionality. Most likely Djordje ( @marcetin#7333 ) will be ready to start applying the work he has been doing on a Golang based CMS inspired by WordPress, to the building of the new wallet GUI interface.

The interface will be served as a web application by an instance of `duo` and will be usable as an installable Progressive Web App as well as later having also an Electron interface that builds out of the main repository. It is intended that this interface will later on expand to encompass an exchange, social network, email and instant messaging system, components that will be developed for the network once the base blockchain token ledger has a fully revised client.

Because the client is written in Go, it is possible to compile binaries for every major platform including iOS and Android, and will work the same way on all, the main app logic is in the server, and this communicates via HTTP with a standard web browser front end to render the interface and data.

The first thing that will be additional in the wallet application compared to standard offerings is a block explorer. It will be basically the same as one served by a website but directly queries the running client or proxies through to another, such as a public RPC server, one's own server or used by a small, trusted group. There will be no need for an additional 'light client' protocol, as one's local instance in all cases handles the storage of sensitive user data, and thus only viable attacks are through manipulating transaction data sent to be approved by the network.

## Web application development

Djordje is in the process of developing a CMS based on the Iris engine, based on the architecture of WordPress. This will form the basis of all web applications built for the Parallelcoin project including block explorers, cryptocurrency database, the wallet app itself, and likely also for the exchange, social forum and decentralised CVS that are slated for future development.
